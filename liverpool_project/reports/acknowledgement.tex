\indent This work would not have been possible without the support of Auston University.
I am especially indebted to Dr. Thet Htun Khine, who have been supportive of my research and who worked actively to provide me with the
protected academic time to meet the required goals.
I am grateful to all of those with whom I have had the pleasure to work during this and other related
projects.

Nobody has been more important to me in the pursuit of this project than the members of my family, and friends. I
would like to thank my parents, whose love and guidance are with me in whatever I pursue. They are the
ultimate role models. Importantly, I wish to thank my friends, Ko Htet Linn Aung, Ko Minn Bo Bo, Ko Naing Lin Aung for support when I damaged
my laptop and when I was stuck during research. 
Futhermore, I would like to deliver graditude to my lovely girlfriend, Ma Shunn Le Yee, who provided me with much needed emotinal
support.
