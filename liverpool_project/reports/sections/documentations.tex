\subsection{Testing}

This module is tested using a data loop-back test. Input data is transmitted through \textbf{uart\_tx\_line} and the transmitted signal is fed back into \textbf{uart\_rx\_line}. A testbench is used to do the loop-back testing. The signals within the testbench is denoted with \_tb suffice. Modelsim is used to simulated the module.
